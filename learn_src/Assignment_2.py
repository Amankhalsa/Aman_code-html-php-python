Python Assignment Operators
Operator  Example     Same As
=        x = 5        x = 5    
+=       x += 3       x = x + 3    
-=       x -= 3       x = x - 3    
*=       x *= 3       x = x * 3    
/=       x /= 3       x = x / 3    
%=       x %= 3       x = x % 3    
//=      x //= 3      x = x // 3    
**=      x **= 3      x = x ** 3    
&=       x &= 3       x = x & 3    
|=       x |= 3       x = x | 3    
^=       x ^= 3       x = x ^ 3    
>>=      x >>= 3      x = x >> 3    
<<=      x <<= 3      x = x << 3
