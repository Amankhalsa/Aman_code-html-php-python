The following are the most commonly used events:
Mouse Events:
click occurs when an element is clicked.
dblclick occurs when an element is double-clicked.
mouseenter occurs when the mouse pointer is over (enters) the selected element.
mouseleave occurs when the mouse pointer leaves the selected element.
mouseover occurs when the mouse pointer is over the selected element.
Keyboard Events:
keydown occurs when a keyboard key is pressed down.
keyup occurs when a keyboard key is released.
Form Events:
submit occurs when a form is submitted.
change occurs when the value of an element has been changed.
focus occurs when an element gets focus.
blur occurs when an element loses focus.
Document Events:
ready occurs when the DOM has been loaded.
resize occurs when the browser window changes size.
scroll occurs when the user scrolls in the specified element.
As an example, let's change the content of a div when the user types in an input field. To do that, we need to handle the keydown event, which occurs when a key on the keyboard is pressed:
