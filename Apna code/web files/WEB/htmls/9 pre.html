<pre width="15">On the Insert tab,the galleries include items that 
are designed  to coordinate with the overall 
<hr color=red width=50% align=left>
look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables,
headers,footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks.
When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with
 your current document look.

<p><blockquote><q>You can easily change the formatting of selected text 
in the document text by choosing a look for the selected text 
from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also
 format text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. 
Most controls offer a choice of using the
 look from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly.
