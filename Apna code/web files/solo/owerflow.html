<pre>	The overflow Property Values

There are four values for the overflow property: visible (the default value), scroll, hidden, and auto.

The value scroll results in clipped overflow, but a scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may be seen.</pre>

<div>
This text is inside the div element, which has a blue 
background color and is floated to the left. We set a specific 
height and width for the div element, and as you can see, 
the content cannot fit.
